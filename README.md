# Hello world, I am John

Welcome. This is my Manager README. It is an attempt to introduce you to my management style, philosophy and expectations. It is a work-in-progress and its aim is to provide you with a way to better understand me.  

## My role as your leader

My role here is to make our team successful. I am a firm believer that I work for you and not the other way around.

As your leader:

* I will be your champion.

* I will provide context for you.

* I will help to unblock you.

* I will help you be more productive

I am not here as *the decider*. I wil attempt to communicate my vision, the context and goals to allow you to come up with the best solutions to help get us there. 

## My Expectations

I am a strong advocate of a growth mindset. To that end I expect you to:

* Embrace challenges

* Persist in the face of setbacks

* Learn from critiscism

* Disagree with me.

* Tell me when I screw up.

## What do I value most?

There are a lot of things I value but here are some key things that will help us all be successful:

* Be honest.

* Be ethical.

* Be transparent.

* Be vocal.

* Be open to feedback.

## Our 1:1s

I am a big believer in regular communication. I will setup 30 minute 1:1s with you on a regular basis, just let me know what cadence works best for you. 

Agenda is yours - you tell me what you would like to talk about. Occasionally I will have items to bring up, but I will always ensure the focus is on areas that you want to talk about.

They don't need to be status updates (unless you want them to be). Ideas that might be useful to talk about could be aspirations, challenges, areas of concern.

Outside of the regular 1:1s, if you want to talk, feel free to schedule time with me. My calendar is usually up to date so throw some time on it for us to connect and I will prioritize it.

## My availability

I strive to make myself available between 9am-5pm. I sometimes like to work in the evening or early morning - but this is a personal preference and I do not expect anyone else to do the same, we all work in different ways. 

If I send a communication outside of 9am-5pm then please feel free to ignore it until a more appropriate time for you. 

I actively use Teams and email and can be reached via either. On Teams, I will likely respond fairly quickly, email maybe a bit slower. 

If you need to reach me urgently then you can reach out to my cell phone at anytime.
